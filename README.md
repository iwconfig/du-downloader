## This is just a dump right now. Salvage what you want and need.

Did this somewhat in a hurry but had a little too fun with the logging module. Probably the most useful part of all this scrap is `blah.Downloader` in `blah.py`, but i'm keeping `main.py` because there is some valuable stuff there as well.

### Requirements

    pip install -U -r requirements.txt

I use selenium for collecting cookie credentials during login because i'm lazy, requests-html because it is awesome and the same goes for youtube-dl

Don't mind the naming convention. I didn't even bother with changing the filenames to something better than "blah.py" :)
